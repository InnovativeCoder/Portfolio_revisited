      I strongly believe that constant learning is a part of our journey, and if
      at some point one stops the process, that person is out of the game. My
      constant learning in both horizontal and vertical dimensions has landed me
      some of the best opportunities I could have ever dreamt of, in the last
      few years. Coming from a strong tech background, spending most of my time
      learning and teaching code, I found another vertical of mine which was to
      do marketing and become an influencer. Currently, I have more than 100k
      followers on Instagram, a top blogger tag on Quora, and a highly enganging
      audience on LinkedIn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spending almost four years into machine learning and artificial
      intelligence, teaching and assisting more than 500 students, winning three
      hackathons and giving a lot of talks, I stepped into research where I
      published 3 research papers. I am a researcher turned Enterpreneur as
      after continuing my research for 18 months, I thought of a product around
      it and presented it to the audience. My research revolves around AI
      psycholgy and multimodal analysis of data.

      Social media is a tool you can use to leverage your digital identity, an
      identity on which only you have the control. I am a product of digital
      identity and stronly beleive in creating an online presence.
